# MyST Enhancement Proposal Bootstrap Process

## Overview

This was an original conversation amongst the Executable Books Team to bootstrap the MyST Enhancement Proposal process.

As this process was informal and designed to create a minimal structure we could iterate on, we list anybody that participated in the conversation in the discussion linked above, or that was recommended by another author of this MEP.
Authors are listed in alphabetical order by first name.

## Where conversation happened

As there was no official process yet, we used the following PR to discuss and iterate on language around this MEP proposal:

https://github.com/executablebooks/meta/pull/843

## Implementation

Implementation for this MEP was done via merging that PR, and then by creating this repository.
The PR that merges this document will finish implementing `MEP-0001`.
